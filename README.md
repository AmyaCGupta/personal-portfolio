# Personal Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It showcases my skills, about me, and a contact form.

## Pages
- **Home:** Introduction and overview.
- **About Me:** Information about my background, diploma in Computer Science, skills, and current goals.
- **Contact:** Contact form to reach me (works locally with PHP & XAMPP).

## Features
- Responsive layout
- Clean and modern design
- Simple navigation

## How to View
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the website locally.
3. For the contact form to work, run the site using a local server like XAMPP.

## Future Improvements
- Deploy the contact form using a static form service for online submissions.
- Add projects section when ready.
